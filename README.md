# DSA_java
This contains the implementation of basic data structures and algorithms in java for my convenience, hopefully enough for a solid foundation 

Currently contains the code for:
1) Linked List
2) Stack using primitive arrays and linked list each
3) Queue using primitve arrays and linked list each
4) Binary tree
5) Binary search tree
6) Min and Max heap using primitive arrays
7) Graph using adjacent matrix
